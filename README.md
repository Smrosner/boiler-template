# Boiler Template - React Webpack Babel Boilerplate

## Description

The "Boiler Template" project serves as a boilerplate for future React projects. This boilerplate is configured with Webpack and Babel to facilitate a streamlined and efficient development experience. It is a great alternative to Create React App for setting up a React project from scratch.

## Features

- **React 18**: The project is set up with the latest version of React for building modern user interfaces.
- **Webpack & Babel**: Utilizes Webpack for bundling modules and Babel for compiling JavaScript code to ensure compatibility across all browsers.
- **Express Server**: Includes a basic Express server setup for serving the built application.
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Allows real-time updates without refreshing the page.
- **CSS Module Support**: Includes configuration for loading CSS modules, making it easier to style your React components.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:\

## Usage

### Development

The server will start at port 3000, and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.
